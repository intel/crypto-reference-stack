# Intel&reg; Crypto Reference Stack

## Overview

Crypto Reference Stack (CRS) provides a highly optimized software stack that
accelerates the processing of the Transport Layer Security (TLS), by using
the built-in
[Intel® Crypto](https://newsroom.intel.com/articles/crypto-acceleration-enabling-path-future-computing/)
Acceleration included in the new
[3rd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/xeon/3rd-gen-xeon-scalable-processors-brief.html),
which also feature a flexible architecture with integrated artificial
intelligence (AI) acceleration with Intel® DL Boost technology.

CRS provides an extended NGINX\* working with Asynchronous Mode OpenSSL\*
and WordPress\*/MySQL\* for demonstrating new Intel® Cryptography
instructions validated in
[3rd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/xeon/3rd-gen-xeon-scalable-processors-brief.html).

## Optimized NGINX for Cryptography

Extended NGINX\* working with Asynchronous Mode OpenSSL\* is part of
Intel&reg Crypto Reference Stack, optimized for Web Services use cases.
NGINX\* is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and
reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server. NGINX\* is known
for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple
configuration, and low resource consumption.

Crypto Reference Stack NGINX* is packaged as a Docker container with
a set of scripts to build components including:

- [OpenSSL Project](https://github.com/openssl/openssl)
- [Intel® Integrated Performance Primitives Cryptography](https://github.com/intel/ipp-crypto)
- [Intel(R) Multi-Buffer Crypto for IPsec Library](https://github.com/intel/intel-ipsec-mb)
- [Intel® QuickAssist Technology(QAT) OpenSSL* Engine](https://github.com/intel/QAT_Engine)
- [Asynch Mode for NGINX*](https://github.com/intel/asynch_mode_nginx)

The documentation related to build and deploy NGINX\* as a standalone
web server working with Asynchronous Mode OpenSSL* can be found at:

- https://github.com/intel/crypto-reference-stack/blob/main/nginx/centos8/README.md

## WordPress/MySQL

WordPress* is a free and open-source content management system written in
PHP and paired with a MySQL database.

MySQL* is a widely used, open-source relational database management
system (RDBMS).

The documentation related to build NGINX\* and deploy the WordPress\*/MySQL\*
stack can be found at:

- https://github.com/intel/crypto-reference-stack/blob/main/wordpress/centos8/README.md
